# KotlinWeatherApp

A simple weather app for android. Display's temperature, humidity, pressure, min-max temp and also gives a description on the weather.

Made with android studio and kotlin.
<br>
<br>
Made through following a tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0g1a75Lmo.
<h2>Configuration</h2>
To test, emulate and build android studio is needed, preferably newer versions.
<br>
Uses Android 8 or above, run's them as well. Don't know if it will work with older versions like Android 7. Haven't tested yet.
<br>
<br>
OpenWeather's Api https://openweathermap.org/ is needed. You must get your own api key or token when making it into a real app. If the purpose is only for testing or so
you may use the token already in the project.
